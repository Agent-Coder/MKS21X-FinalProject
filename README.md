I worked on writing the Square class and finished all of the methods we initially decided to write. I also changed some private methods to public methods.

AZ;01-03-19;
I finished creating the board and the Start screen that appears when the file is run

AC;01-04-19
I wrote the toString method for the Square class and started writing the constructor for the board class.

AZ;01-04-19;
I added all the private variables for Board class and fixed the Startgame Method to be compatible with lanterna. Then, I wrote the constructor for Board and tweaked the toString of Square.

AZ;01-06-19;
Big Progress!:) I finished the constructor of the block class and added new instance variable to make it easier to do the toString. I also finished the toString and everytime u rerun the program and make a block its a different one. However-big obstance!-some of the randomly generated blocks are disjointed! So we are going to have to come up with an algorithm to generate different JOINTED blocks.

Board is now on lantera! After some experimenting, I added the lanterna functionality to the game. However, I believe that the Board class is suppose to be our driver class? We will clarify this after a discussion.

AC;01-07-19;
Changed Board class so it is not the driver; drive is now a new class called game. When running the game, there is now three modes: the start screen, the game screen, and the pause screen. I will design the start and pause screen in the future. The game screen displays the board.

AZ;01-07-19;
We decided to make the block class have three little child block classes that are three types: Full, Long, and L-shaped. I finished creating the three block classes and we are able to print it out in main after constructin them.
