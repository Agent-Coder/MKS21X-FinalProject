I worked on writing the Square class and finished all of the methods we initially decided to write. I also changed some private methods to public methods.

AZ;01-03-19;
I finished creating the board and the Start screen that appears when the file is run

AC;01-04-19
I wrote the toString method for the Square class and started writing the constructor for the board class.

AZ;01-04-19;
I added all the private variables for Board class and fixed the Startgame Method to be compatible with lanterna. Then, I wrote the constructor for Board and tweaked the toString of Square.

AZ;01-06-19;
Big Progress!:) I finished the constructor of the block class and added new instance variable to make it easier to do the toString. I also finished the toString and everytime u rerun the program and make a block its a different one. However-big obstance!-some of the randomly generated blocks are disjointed! So we are going to have to come up with an algorithm to generate different JOINTED blocks.
